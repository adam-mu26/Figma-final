Reason why I choose blue color in my design
       **************************
-Calm your audience 
it’s calming, soothing, and symbolizes the positive. Bright blues inspire 
ideas of loyalty, confidence, security, and reliable authority. Many 
companies and brands use these shades in their logos and messaging 
precisely because of these associations.

As the color of the sky and the sea, blue is also used to imply a 
connection to nature. The turquoise shades you might see in the waters of 
the Caribbean Sea not only calm people but can also energize them. Light 
sky blue can make people feel contemplative and serene.


Why I used grey?
      ************************** 
A truly neutral shade, gray is often thoughtfully used as a secondary 
color or an accent color to direct attention elsewhere. Unlike most 
colors, gray can be used with almost any other color as a complementary 
background.
